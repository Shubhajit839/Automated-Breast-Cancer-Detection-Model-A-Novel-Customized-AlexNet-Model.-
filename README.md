# Automated-Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model-A-Novel-Customized-AlexNet-Model.-
This project focuses on developing an automated breast cancer detection model using a customized version of the AlexNet convolutional neural network (CNN). By leveraging deep learning techniques, the project aims to create an accurate and efficient model that can assist radiologists in detecting breast cancer from mammogram images. The customized AlexNet model will be trained and optimized specifically for breast cancer detection, enhancing its ability to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.
